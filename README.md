A small game written in Godot v3.4.4 by Ruslan Prigarin on Dec 21, 2022.

You play as a triangle that collects stars, which randomly spawn on your screen at set intervals.
The goal is to catch as many as you can to get the highest score.
Stars mutate over time into red shards which defeat you in one hit, at which point the game ends.
