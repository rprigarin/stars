# Stars
A small game written in Godot v3.4.4 by Ruslan Prigarin on Dec 21, 2022. Also known as "Mutating Stars".

You play as a triangle that collects stars, which randomly spawn on your screen at set intervals.
Stars mutate over time into red shards which defeat you in one hit, at which point the game ends.
The goal is to catch as many stars as you can to get the highest score until you get killed by a red shard.
